Miscellaneous design notes:

- The player character does not have magic or know spells
- The player character is common adventurer, not a "chosen one"
- There aren't classes: only Skills
- The player can choose initial Skills and skill levels
- The player can choose initial Conditions. Example: adding/removing Hunger would mean they do / do not need to regularly eat to control their fatigure level
- Potions should eventually be very rare
- Physicians, herbalists, rest, and food should be the primary ways to regenerate helath
- Oils for weapons (ala Witcher 3) should exist
- There is no automap. The player knows the region they are in, they can find/buy a map of the region, but it will not automark where they are in that region (finding visual cues to pinpoint their position should be a fun way to figure out where they are)
- The game should not be "brutally hard" like many roguelikes (despite some roguelike characteristics to the game)
