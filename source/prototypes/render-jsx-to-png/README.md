# render-jsx-to-png

## Purpose

The purpose of this prototype was to see how difficult it was to create PNG files directly from a React-based JSX defintiion.

**Conclusion: the satori library makes it not difficult at all.**

## Motivation

The motivation for this prototype was thinking about in-game "signs" and text.

One thought was it might be easier to define such assets in JSX and render those to images (i.e. textures) rather than trying to build an in-game UI system.
