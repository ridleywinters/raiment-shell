# raiment-dev-server

A simple development server with basic file serving, file read/write APIs, server-side messaging, and client-side reloading. It is intended to make writing internal web apps quicker and easier.

**IMPORTANT**: This server is **not secure or optimized** and is intended only for local, internal development.

The server makes a number of assumptions about this project and is not designed to be a generalized development web server.
